## My process

- I wrote the html section first then proceeded to teh Css part
- After I've done my best to design the major part,I watched a video about the same design to address issues such as:adding backgroud image,centering the main container e.t.c.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I gained more insight on how to apply flexbox easily
- I learnt how to add background image correctly


### Continued development

- I would love to work more on perfecting my flexbox understanding and gain more insight on the application of my Css grid knowledge

### Useful resources
